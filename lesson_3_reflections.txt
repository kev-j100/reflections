When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

You would use a remote repository when you are wanting to share your work on GitHub or if you are wanting to collaberate with others.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

You might be in the middle of chaning something and not want to overwrite your changes. 

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When you use one instead of another?

You use forks on git hub itsself to make your own repository. Branches are made locally and are within the same repostory. Clones are copies either from a remote to a local or local to local.
